# Inspiration
We were inspired by the concept of ride sharing apps such as Uber and Lyft. Our goals for this project were to make the process of finding a carpool driver much more personal. We wanted to capitalize on providing services to primarily local neighborhood subsets, where safety and trust would be our greatest goals to emphasize.

# What it does
Our app allows users to create a local ride sharing/carpool message board, where users can submit a request for a ride or an offer to drive others. Each request is highly customizable, allowing for the maximization of flexibility.

# How I built it
We started out developing wireframes for the main elements of our app. Building from a basic framework of a React App we progressively added on features, such as a SQL database to store our users and their data as well as communication between our database and our app. We use a Node Express server to handle database requests.

# Challenges I ran into
Most of our group was not familiar with Javascript, let alone any components of React, so being able to accurately translate all of our ideas to code in the application was a struggle.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
All members of our group had individual skillsets that each excelled at, and allowed culmination of our ideas into one project.

# What I learned
This was a learning experience for all of us, and I believe that we came out of this project with a much clearer understanding of all the components that go into mobile app development.

# What's next for RideShare
RideShares next step would be to continue capitalizing on profile customizability. Such a way could be to add a buddy system bound to each profile. Another way to grow profiles is to add a section for each user to review another user that has provided a service for him/her. Growing even greater, we would start to add in google maps API onto our application.
